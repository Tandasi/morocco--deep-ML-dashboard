# Project Reflections: Indigenous Weather Forecasting Challenge

## What I learned from this journey

Wow, this has been such a fascinating project! I honestly came into this thinking "let's see if traditional methods have any merit," but I'm walking away completely blown away by how sophisticated and accurate these farmers' techniques really are.

The results speak for themselves - we achieved incredible performance using only the natural signs that farmers have been watching for generations. This isn't just lucky guessing; this is real, systematic knowledge that has been tested and refined over centuries.

## Where this could go next

If I wanted to take this further (and honestly, I'm tempted!), there are some cool directions:

- **For competition purposes**: Convert the model to ONNX or TensorFlow Lite format and add some SHAP explainability features to really understand the decision-making process
- **For real-world impact**: This could actually help farming communities by providing scientific validation of their knowledge, maybe even improving early warning systems
- **For other regions**: I'm really curious if similar approaches would work with traditional knowledge systems in other parts of the world

## My biggest takeaway

What strikes me most is how this challenges the whole "traditional vs. modern" thinking. The farmers weren't doing something primitive that we've now "upgraded" with AI. They were doing sophisticated pattern recognition that we've now learned to appreciate and measure scientifically.

There's probably a lot more wisdom out there in traditional knowledge systems that deserves this kind of respectful scientific attention. Sometimes the old ways aren't old because they're outdated - they're old because they work.
